README.txt - This file

build.xml - Setup file to copy all jars to required places

IMPORTANT: 
Before you build rampart from source distribution, you need provision for 
unlimited security jurisdiction as some of the test cases use key size of
256. So you need to download jce_policy-x_y_z.zip (relevant to your JDK version)
and extract the jar files local_policy.jar and US_export_policy.jar to 
$JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security. These files are listed in sun download site,
under the your JDK version as Java(TM) Cryptography Extension (JCE) Unlimited 
Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files. 

Bouncy castle jars are no longer shipped with Rampart binary distribution
due some patent issues.But as bouncy castle jars are necessary for Rampart, users 
will have to manually download and copy the bouncy castle jar corresponding the
relevant JDK. Bouncy castle jars can be downloaded from 
http://www.bouncycastle.org/latest_releases.html 
 
Before you try any of the samples makesure you

1.) Have the Axis2 standard binary distribution downloaded and extracted.
2.) Set the AXIS2_HOME environment variable
3.) Run ant from the "samples" directory to copy the required libraries and
    modules to relevant directories in AXIS2_HOME.
